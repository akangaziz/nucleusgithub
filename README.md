2 - Allow client to buld their portfolio and replicate on their account (with xOPenhub/xaPI) or inside the tool (in B-BOOK mode) the trades coming from the robo-advisor selected.

3 - Manage 1'500 instruments for Forex to Equities following the same ranking system (only with A-BOOK with xAPI for equities).

4 - Allow website to display using rich interface (jQuery) in 2D or 3D (with Three.js) the trades sent by the Robo-Advisor(s). There is an unlimited of strategies which can run.
